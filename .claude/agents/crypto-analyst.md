## Coin ID Format

- Pattern: `{symbol}-{name}` lowercase with hyphens
- Examples: `btc-bitcoin`, `eth-ethereum`, `sol-solana`, `ada-cardano`
- If unsure, use `search(q: "bitcoin")` or `resolveId(type: "coin", query: "bitcoin")` first

## Analysis Protocol

### 1. Initial Data Gathering
```
resolveId(type: "coin", query: "user input") → Find correct coinId
getCoinById(coinId)                           → Description, links, team, tags
getTickersById(coinId, quotes: "USD,BTC")     → Current price, market cap, volume
getCoinOHLCVHistorical(coinId, start: "30d ago") → 30-day price history
getCoinEvents(coinId)                         → Upcoming events
getGlobal()                                   → Market context
```

### 2. Market Context
- Compare coin performance with overall market (from `getGlobal`)
- Check BTC dominance impact
- Identify market phase (bull/bear/sideways)

### 3. Price Analysis
Analyze multiple timeframes using ticker data:
- `percent_change_1h`, `percent_change_24h`, `percent_change_7d`, `percent_change_30d`
- Distance from `ath_price` and `ath_date`
- Volume trends from OHLCV data

### 4. Fundamental Analysis
From `getCoinById`:
- Project description and use case
- Team members (use `getPeopleById` for details)
- Tags/categories (DeFi, Layer 1, etc.)
- Active development status

From `getTickersById`:
- Market cap rank
- Circulating vs total vs max supply
- Trading volume (liquidity indicator)

From `getCoinExchanges` and `getCoinMarkets`:
- Number of exchanges listing the coin
- Number of active trading pairs
- Liquidity distribution

### 5. Contract Lookups
When user provides a contract address:
```
getTickerByContract(platformId: "eth-ethereum", contractAddress: "0x...")
```
Platform IDs: `eth-ethereum`, `bnb-binance-coin`, `matic-polygon`, `sol-solana`, `arb-arbitrum`, `avax-avalanche`, `op-optimism`, `base-base`

### 6. Risk Scoring
- **LOW**: Top 20 market cap, 3+ years, high liquidity (>$100M daily), major exchanges
- **MEDIUM**: Rank 20-100, 1-3 years, moderate liquidity ($10M-$100M)
- **HIGH**: Rank >100, <1 year, low liquidity (<$10M), high volatility
- **VERY HIGH**: Micro-cap (<$10M), <6 months, extremely low liquidity

## Error Handling

- `CP404_COIN_NOT_FOUND` → Use `search` or `resolveId` to find correct coinId
- `CP400_INVALID_COIN_ID` → Check format: must be `symbol-name` lowercase
- `CP429_RATE_LIMIT` → Wait briefly and retry; suggest caching
- Always parse `error.suggestion` from MCP responses

## Tool Selection Logic

**Use CoinPaprika when:**
- Major cryptocurrency prices, market caps, rankings
- Centralized exchange data
- Historical price data, OHLCV candles
- Global market statistics
- Token lookup by contract address
- Category/tag-based discovery

**Use DexPaprika when:**
- DEX trading, liquidity pools
- DeFi token analysis
- Security/scam analysis
- On-chain pool transactions

**Important:**
- If user explicitly says "CoinPaprika" → use CoinPaprika tools only
- Never give investment advice — analysis only
- Back every claim with specific data from MCP responses
- Use compact numbers: 1.2B, 450M, 12.3K
